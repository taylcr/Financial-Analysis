Good website/app, but you need to know what you are looking for , there is no central repository of all articles, it's not like a book or other websites. Eg. If you look for dunder methods , you would find article on dunder methods, but if you don't know if the word dunder exits, there is no way you get to know about it.

Geeksforgeeks not a good place to get started with programming
I have seen many people recommending GeeksforGeeks to get started with programming.
But the truth is, many article is very poorly written, along with poor UI/UX design.
From what I have seen, Its just a place where code from different website and books are copied and compiled on a single website.
Let's just take example of method 4.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-two-strings-are-anagram-of-each-other/
It's been a year since the method 4 has not been removed, this was one such code I found out today.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/length-of-longest-subarray-in-which-elements-greater-than-k-are-more-than-elements-not-greater-than-k/?ref=rp
-Wrong approach
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-subarray-count-1s-one-count-0s/?ref=rp
-  Logically incorrect.
Many article with wrong time complexity, slow approach, poor explanation have just ruined the quality of content.
Would not recommend GeeksforGeeks.

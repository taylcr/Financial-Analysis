Apple Inc.
is an American
multinational corporation
and
technology company
headquartered and incorporated in
Cupertino, California
, in
Silicon Valley
. It is best known for its
consumer electronics
,
software
, and
services
. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by
Steve Jobs
,
Steve Wozniak
and
Ronald Wayne
, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the
largest technology company by revenue
, with
US$383.29
billion in 2023.
The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's
Apple I
personal computer. Its second computer, the
Apple II
, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced
microcomputers
. Apple introduced the
Lisa
in 1983 and the
Macintosh
in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a
graphical user interface
and a
mouse
. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form
NeXT, Inc.
, and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures;
John Sculley
served as long-time CEO for over a decade. In the 1990s, Apple lost considerable
market share
in the
personal computer
industry to the lower-priced
Wintel
duopoly of the
Microsoft Windows
operating system
on
Intel
-powered
PC clones
. In 1997, Apple was weeks away from
bankruptcy
. To resolve its failed operating system strategy, it bought NeXT, effectively bringing Jobs back to the company, who guided Apple back to profitability over the next decade with the introductions of the
iMac
,
iPod
,
iPhone
, and
iPad
devices to critical acclaim as well as the
iTunes Store
, launching the ""
Think different
""
advertising
campaign, and opening the
Apple Store
retail chain. These moves elevated Apple to consistently be one of the world's
most valuable brands
since about 2010. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later; he was succeeded as CEO by
Tim Cook
.
Apple's current product lineup
includes portable and home hardware such as the iPhone, iPad,
Apple Watch
,
Mac
, and
Apple TV
;
operating systems
such as
iOS
,
iPadOS
, and
macOS
; and
various software
and services including
Apple Pay
,
iCloud
, and multimedia
streaming
services like
Apple Music
and
Apple TV+
. Apple is one of the
Big Five
American
information technology
companies;
[
a
]
for the most part since 2011,
[
b
]
Apple has been the world's
largest company by market capitalization
, and, as of 2023
[update]
, is the
largest manufacturing company by revenue
, the
fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales
, the
largest vendor of tablet computers
, and the
largest vendor of mobile phones
in the world.
Apple became the first

History of Apple Inc. § 1971–1985: Jobs and Wozniak
In 1976,
Steve Jobs
and
Steve Wozniak
co-founded Apple in Jobs's parents' home on Crist Drive in
Los Altos, California
.
[

]
Wozniak called the popular belief that the company was founded in the garage ""a bit of a myth"",
[
9
]
although they moved some operations to the garage when the bedroom became too crowded.
[
10
]
The
Apple I
is Apple's first product, designed by Wozniak and sold as an assembled circuit board without the required keyboard, monitor, power supply, and the optional case.
The
Apple II
, introduced in 1977 and designed primarily by Wozniak, was the company's first major success.
Apple Computer Company
was founded on April 1, 1976, by
Steve Jobs
,
Steve Wozniak
, and
Ronald Wayne
as a
partnership
.
[

]
[
11
]
The company's first product is the
Apple I
, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.
[
12
]
To finance its creation, Jobs sold his
Volkswagen Bus
, and Wozniak sold his
HP-65
calculator.
[
13
]
: 57
Neither received the full selling price but in total earned
$1,300
(equivalent to $7,000 in 2023). Wozniak debuted the first prototype
Apple I
at the
Homebrew Computer Club
in July 1976.
[
14
]
The Apple I was sold as a
motherboard
with
CPU
,
RAM
, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which was not yet marketed as a complete personal computer.
[
15
]
It was priced soon after debut for
$666.66
(equivalent to $3,600 in 2023).
[
16
]
[
17
]
: 180
Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental
mark of the beast
in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked ""repeating digits"".
[
18
]
Apple Computer, Inc.
was incorporated in
Cupertino, California
,
[
1
]
on January 3, 1977,
[
19
]
[
20
]
without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded it.
[
21
]
Multimillionaire
Mike Markkula
provided essential business expertise and funding of
$250,000
(equivalent to $1,257,000 in 2023) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.
[
22
]
During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to
US$118
million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.
[
23
]
The
Apple II
, also designed by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first
West Coast Computer Faire
.
[
24
]
It differs from its major rivals, the
TRS-80
and
Commodore PET
, because of its character cell-based color graphics and
open architecture
. The Apple I and early Apple II models use ordinary
audio cassette tapes
as storage devices, which were superseded by the
5
+
1
⁄
4
-inch
floppy disk
drive and interface called the
Disk II
in 1978.
[
25
]
[
26
]
The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first
killer application
of the business world:
VisiCalc
, a
spreadsheet
program
released in 1979.
[
25
]
VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office,
[
25
]
but Apple II market share remained behind
home computers
made by competitors such as
Atari
,
Commodore
, and
Tandy
.
[
27
]
[
28
]
On December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol ""AAPL"") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for
stock splits
as of September 3, 2022
[update]
),
[
20
]
generating over $100 million, which was more capital than any IPO since
Ford Motor Company
in 1956.
[
29
]
By the end of the day, around 300 millionaires were created, including Jobs and Wozniak, from a stock price of $29 per share
[
30
]
and a market cap of $1.778 billion.

1980–1990: Success with Macintosh
See also:
List of Mac models
and
Timeline of the Apple II family
Steve Jobs
in 1984 with the
Macintosh
, the first mass-market personal computer to feature an integral
graphical user interface
and
mouse
In December 1979, Steve Jobs and Apple employees, including
Jef Raskin
, visited
Xerox PARC
, where they observed the
Xerox Alto
, featuring a
graphical user interface
(GUI). Apple subsequently negotiated access to PARC's technology, leading to Apple's option to buy shares at a preferential rate. This visit influenced Jobs to implement a GUI in Apple's products, starting with the
Apple Lisa
. Despite being pioneering as a mass-marketed GUI computer, the Lisa suffered from high costs and limited software options, leading to commercial failure.
Jobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's
Macintosh
division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.
[
31
]
Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue.
[
32
]
In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer without a bundled
programming language
.
[
33
]
Its debut was signified by ""
1984
"", a
US$1.5
million television advertisement directed by
Ridley Scott
that aired during the third quarter of
Super Bowl XVIII
on January 22, 1984.
[
34
]
This was hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success
[
35
]
and was called a ""masterpiece"" by
CNN
[
36
]
and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by
TV Guide
.
[
37
]
The advertisement created great interest in
Macintosh
, and sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in. Jobs had required
128 kilobytes
of RAM, which limited its speed and software in favor of aspiring for a projected price point of
$1,000
(equivalent to $2,900 in 2023). The Macintosh shipped for
$2,495
(equivalent to $7,300 in 2023), a price panned by critics due to its slow performance.
[
38
]
: 195
In early 1985, this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO
John Sculley
, who had been hired away from
Pepsi
two years earlier by Jobs
[
39
]
saying, ""Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?""
[
40
]
Sculley removed Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division, with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.
[
41
]
The board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from leadership.
[
42
]
Jean-Louis Gassée
informed Sculley that Jobs had been attempting to organize a
boardroom coup
and called an emergency meeting at which Apple's executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties.
[
42
]
Jobs resigned from Apple in September 1985 and took several Apple employees with him to found
NeXT
.
[
43
]
Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in 1985 to pursue other ventures, expressing his frustration with Apple's treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had ""been going in the wrong direction for the last five years"".
[
32
]
[
44
]
[
45
]
Wozniak remained employed by Apple as a representative,
[
44
]
receiving a stipend estimated to be $120,000 per year.
[
17
]
Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders following their departures.
[
46
]
After the departures of Jobs and Wozniak in 1985, Sculley launched the
Macintosh 512K
that year with quadruple the RAM, and introduced the
LaserWriter
, the first reasonably priced
PostScript
laser printer
.
PageMaker
, an early
desktop publishing
application taking advantage of the PostScript language, was also released by
Aldus Corporation
in July 1985.
[
47
]
It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh, LaserWriter, and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the
desktop publishing
market.
[
48
]
This dominant position in the desktop publishing market
[
49
]
allowed the company to focus on higher price points, the so-called ""high-right policy"" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher
profit margin
, and appeared to have no effect on total sales as
power users
snapped up every increase in speed. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, due to Jean-Louis Gassée's slogan of ""fifty-five or die"", referring to the 55%
profit margins
of the
Macintosh II
.
[
50
]
: 79–80
This policy began to backfire late in the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on
IBM PC compatibles
with some of the same functionality of the Macintosh at far lower price points. The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford Apple products. The
Christmas season
of 1989 was the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.
[
50
]
: 117–129
During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing
Michael Spindler
as the
chief operating officer
.
[
51
]
Gassée left the company later that year to set up a rival,
Be Inc.
[
52
]
1990–1997: Decline and restructuring
Macintosh
LC II
The company pivoted strategy and, in October 1990, introduced three lower-cost models: the
Macintosh Classic
, the
Macintosh LC
, and the
Macintosh IIsi
, all of which generated significant sales due to pent-up demand.
[
53
]
In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful
PowerBook
with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced
System 7
, a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.
The success of the lower-cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue.
[
54
]
For some time, Apple was doing very well, introducing fresh new products at increasing profits. The magazine
MacAddict
named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the ""first golden age"" of the Macintosh.
[
55
]
The
PenLite
is Apple's first tablet computer prototype, created in 1992 to bring the Mac OS to a tablet. It was canceled in favor of the
Newton
.
[
56
]
The success of lower-cost consumer Macs, especially the LC, cannibalized higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points, for different markets: the high-end
Quadra
series, the mid-range
Centris
series, and the consumer-marketed
Performa
series. This led to significant consumer confusion between so many models.
[
57
]
In 1993, the
Apple II
series was discontinued. It was expensive to produce, and the company decided it was still absorbing sales from lower-cost Macintosh models. After the launch of the LC, Apple encouraged developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to redirect consumers from Apple II and toward Macintosh.
[
58
]
The
Apple IIe
was discontinued in 1993.
[
59
]
Apple experimented with several other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including
QuickTake
digital cameras
,
PowerCD
portable CD audio players,
speakers
, the
Pippin
video game console, the
eWorld
online service, and
Apple Interactive Television Box
. Enormous resources were invested in the problematic
Newton
tablet division, based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.
[
60
]
Throughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with
Windows
by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.
[
61
]
Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; it sued Microsoft for making a GUI similar to the
Lisa
in
Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.
[
62
]
The lawsuit dragged on for years and was finally dismissed. The major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apple's reputation, and in 1993 Sculley was replaced as CEO by
Michael Spindler
.
[
63
]
The
Power Macintosh 6100
, introduced in 1994, was Apple's first new home computer model after the switch to
PowerPC
processors.
Under Spindler, Apple,
IBM
, and
Motorola
formed the
AIM alliance
in 1994 to create a new computing platform (the
PowerPC Reference Platform
or PReP), with IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows. That year, Apple introduced the
Power Macintosh
, the first of many computers with Motorola's
PowerPC
processor.
[
64
]
In the wake of the alliance, Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build
Macintosh clones
. Over the next two years, 75 distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced. However, by 1996, Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of its own high-end computers, where profit margins were highest.
[
65
]
In 1996, Spindler was replaced as CEO by
Gil Amelio
, who was hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator. Amelio made deep changes, including extensive layoffs and cost-cutting.
[
66
]
This period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system (MacOS). The original Macintosh operating system (
System 1
) was not built for multitasking (running several applications at once). The company attempted to correct this by introducing
cooperative multitasking
in System 5, but still decided it needed a more modern approach.
[
67
]
This led to the
Pink
project in 1988,
A/UX
that same year,
Copland
in 1994, and evaluated the purchase of
BeOS
in 1996. Talks with Be stalled when the CEO, former Apple executive
Jean-Louis Gassée
, demanded $300 million in contrast to Apple's $125 million offer.
[
68
]
Only weeks away from
bankruptcy
,
[
69
]
Apple's board preferred
NeXTSTEP
and purchased
NeXT
in late 1996 for $400 million, retaining
Steve Jobs
.
[
70
]
1997–2007: Return to profitability
The NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997,
[
71
]
and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio's resignation after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses. The board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately reviewed the product lineup. Jobs canceled 70% of models, ending 3,000 jobs and paring to the core of its computer offerings.
[
72
]
The next month, in August 1997, Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a $150 million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing Mac software.
[
73
]
This was seen as an ""antitrust insurance policy"" for Microsoft which had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti-competitive practices in the
United States v. Microsoft Corp.
case.
[
74
]
Around then, Jobs donated Apple's internal library and archives to
Stanford University
, to focus more on the present and the future rather than the past.
[
75
]
[
76
]
He ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997, purchased the largest clone maker,
Power Computing
.
[
77
]
On November 10, 1997, the
Apple Store website
launched, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing model similar to PC manufacturer
Dell
's success.
[
78
]
The moves paid off for Jobs; at the end of his first year as CEO, the company had a $309 million profit.
[
72
]
iMac
iBook
Power Macintosh G3
PowerBook G3
On May 6, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh: the
iMac
. The iMac was a huge success, with 800,000 units sold in its first five months,
[
79
]
and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the
3
+
1
⁄
2
-inch diskette
, being an early adopter of the
USB
connector, and coming pre-installed with Internet connectivity (the ""i"" in iMac)
[
80
]
via Ethernet and a dial-up modem. Its striking teardrop shape and translucent materials were designed by
Jonathan Ive
, who had been hired by Amelio, and who collaborated with Jobs for more than a decade to reshape Apple's product design.
[
81
]
[
82
]
A little more than a year later on July 21, 1999, Apple introduced the
iBook
consumer laptop. It culminated Jobs's strategy to produce only four products: refined versions of the
Power Macintosh G3
desktop and
PowerBook G3
laptop for professionals, and the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers. Jobs said the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation.
[
83
]
Around then, Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers. Apple acquired
Macromedia
's Key Grip digital video editing software project which was launched as
Final Cut Pro
in April 1999.
[
84
]
Key Grip's development also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product
iMovie
in October 1999.
[
85
]
Apple acquired the German company Astarte in April 2000, which had developed the
DVD authoring
software DVDirector, which Apple repackaged as the professional-oriented
DVD Studio Pro
, and reused its technology to create
iDVD
for the consumer market.
[
85
]
In 2000, Apple purchased the
SoundJam MP
audio player software from
Casady & Greene
. Apple renamed the program
iTunes
, and simplified the user interface and added CD burning.
[
86
]
In 2001, Apple changed course with three announcements. First, on March 24, 2001, Apple announced the release of a new modern operating system,
Mac OS X
. This was after numerous failed attempts in the early 1990s, and several years of development. Mac OS X is based on
NeXTSTEP
,
OpenStep
, and
BSD Unix
, to combine the stability, reliability, and security of
Unix
with the ease of use of an overhauled user interface. Second, in May 2001, the first two
Apple Store
retail locations opened in Virginia and California, offering an improved presentation of the company's products.
[
87
]
[
88
]
[
89
]
At the time, many speculated that the stores would fail, but they became highly successful, and the first of more than 500 stores around the world.
[
90
]
[
91
]
Third, on October 23, 2001, the
iPod
portable digital audio player debuted. The product was first sold on November 10, 2001, and was extremely successful, with over 100 million units sold within six years.
[
92
]
The iTunes Store was highly successful in shaping the legal
music downloading
industry; chart shows the number of songs sold from 2003 to 2010.
In 2003, the
iTunes Store
was introduced with
music downloads
for 99¢ a song and iPod integration. It quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over 5 billion downloads by June 19, 2008.
[
93
]
Two years later, the iTunes Store was the world's largest music retailer.
[
94
]
In 2002, Apple purchased
Nothing Real
for its advanced digital
compositing
application
Shake
,
[
95
]
and
Emagic
for the music productivity application
Logic
. The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company. The acquisition was followed by the development of Apple's consumer-level
GarageBand
application.
[
96
]
The release of
iPhoto
that year completed the
iLife
suite.
[
97
]
The
MacBook Pro
is Apple's first laptop with an
Intel
microprocessor, introduced in 2006.
At the
Worldwide Developers Conference
keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would move away from PowerPC processors, and the
Mac would transition to Intel processors
in 2006.
[
98
]
On January 10, 2006, the new
MacBook Pro
and
iMac
became the first Apple computers to use Intel's
Core Duo
CPU. By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced.
[
98
]
The Power Mac, iBook, and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the
Mac Pro
,
MacBook
, and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.
[
99
]
Apple also introduced
Boot Camp
in 2006 to help users install
Windows XP
or
Windows Vista
on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.
[
100
]
Apple's success during this period was evident in its
stock price
. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple's stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (
split-adjusted
) to over $80.
[
101
]
When Apple surpassed Dell's
market cap
in January 2006,
[
102
]
Jobs sent an email to Apple employees saying Dell's CEO
Michael Dell
should eat his words.
[
103
]
Nine years prior, Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would ""shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders"".
[
104
]
2007–2011: Success with mobile devices
The newly announced
first-generation iPhone
was on display at the 2007
MacWorld Expo
.
During his keynote speech at the
Macworld Expo
on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced the renaming of Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple Inc., because the company had broadened its focus from computers to consumer electronics.
[
105
]
This event also saw the announcement of the
iPhone
[
106
]
and the
Apple TV
.
[
107
]
The company sold 270,000
first-generation iPhones
during the first 30 hours of sales,
[
108
]
and the device was called ""a game changer for the industry"".
[
109
]
In an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the
iTunes Store
without
digital rights management
, thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players if record labels would agree to drop the technology.
[
110
]
On April 2, 2007, Apple and
EMI
jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.
[
111
]
Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce that all songs on the iTunes Store are available without their
FairPlay
DRM.
[
112
]
In July 2008, Apple launched the
App Store
to sell third-party applications for the iPhone and
iPod Touch
.
[
113
]
Within a month, the store sold 60 million applications and registered an average daily revenue of $1 million, with Jobs speculating in August 2008 that the App Store could become a billion-dollar business for Apple.
[
114
]
By October 2008, Apple was the third-largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone.

115
]
A docked
iPod Classic
; Apple worked with other manufacturers to implement purpose-built ""
Made for iPod
"" docking stations.
On January 14, 2009, Jobs announced in an internal memo that he would be taking a six-month medical
leave of absence
from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health. In the email, Jobs stated that ""the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well"", and explained that the break would allow the company ""to focus on delivering extraordinary products"".
[
116
]
Though Jobs was absent, Apple recorded its best non-holiday quarter (Q1 FY 2009) during
the recession
, with revenue of $8.16 billion and profit of $1.21 billion.
[
117
]
After years of speculation and multiple rumored ""leaks"", Apple unveiled a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the
iPad
on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and all iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, though having very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the U.S. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.
[
118
]
In May 2010, Apple's market cap exceeded that of competitor
Microsoft
for the first time since 1989.
[
119
]
In June 2010, Apple released the
iPhone 4
,
[
120
]
which introduced
video calling
using
FaceTime
,
multitasking
, and a new design with an exposed
stainless steel
frame as the phone's antenna system. Later that year, Apple again refreshed the
iPod
line by introducing a
multi-touch
iPod Nano
, an iPod Touch with
FaceTime
, and an

fruitarian
diet.
[

Apple's first logo, designed by
Ron Wayne
, depicts
Sir Isaac Newton
sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by
Rob Janoff
's ""rainbow Apple"", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it.

The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-
CEO
Steve Jobs,
[

after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts.
[
89

Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired
Ron Johnson
in 2000.

Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997,
[
211
]
and opened the first two physical stores in 2001.
[

The media initially speculated that Apple would fail,
[
90
]
but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores, and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.
[

Over the years, Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage, with 499 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of December 2017
[update]

Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.
[

Apple Stores underwent a period of significant redesign, beginning in May 2016. This redesign included physical changes to the Apple Stores, such as open spaces and re-branded rooms, and changes in function to facilitate interaction between consumers and professionals.
[
213

Many Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has built several stand-alone ""flagship"" stores in high-profile locations.
[

It has been granted design
patents
and received architectural awards for its stores' designs and construction, specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes.
[

The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers, who have lost traffic, control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores.
[

Due to the popularity of the brand, Apple receives a large number of job applications, many of which come from young workers.

Although Apple Store employees receive above-average pay, are offered money toward education and health care, and receive product discounts,
[

With the popularity rise of cloud storage solutions, Apple began a technique in 2016 to do
deep learning
scans for facial data in photos on the user's local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to Apple's

It also introduced ""differential privacy"", a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users, while keeping individual users anonymous, in a system that
Wired

, Apple required all developers of iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch applications to directly ask iPhone users permission to track them. The feature, called ""App Tracking Transparency"", received heavy criticism from
Facebook
, whose primary business model revolves around the tracking of users' data and sharing such data with advertisers so users can see more relevant ads, a technique commonly known as
targeted advertising
. After Facebook's measures, including purchasing full-page newspaper advertisements protesting App Tracking Transparency, Apple released the update in early 2021. A study by
Verizon
subsidiary Flurry Analytics reported only 4% of iOS users in the United States and 12% worldwide have opted into tracking.
[

]
Prior to the release of
iOS 15
, Apple announced new efforts at combating
child sexual abuse material
on iOS and Mac platforms. Parents of minor
iMessage
users can now be alerted if their child sends or receives nude photographs. Additionally, on-device
hashing
would take place on media destined for upload to iCloud, and hashes would be compared to a list of known abusive images provided by law enforcement; if enough matches were found, Apple would be alerted and authorities informed. The new features received praise from law enforcement and victims rights advocates. However, privacy advocates, including the
Electronic Frontier Foundation
, condemned the new features as invasive and highly prone to abuse by authoritarian governments.
[
230
]
Ireland's
Data Protection Commission
launched a privacy investigation to examine whether Apple complied with the EU's
GDPR
law following an investigation into how the company processes personal data with targeted ads on its platform.
[
231
]
In December 2019, security researcher
Brian Krebs
discovered that the
iPhone 11 Pro
would still show the arrow indicator –signifying location services are being used– at the top of the screen while the main location services toggle is enabled, despite all individual location services being disabled. Krebs was unable to replicate this behavior on older models and when asking Apple for comment, he was told by Apple that ""It is expected behavior that the Location Services icon appears in the status bar when Location Services is enabled. The icon appears for system services that do not have a switch in Settings.""
[
232
]
Apple later further clarified that this behavior was to ensure compliance with
ultra-wideband
regulations in specific countries, a technology Apple started implementing in iPhones starting with iPhone 11 Pro, and emphasized that ""the management of ultra wideband compliance and its use of location data is done entirely on the device and Apple is not collecting user location data."" Will Strafach, an executive at security firm
Guardian Firewall
, confirmed the lack of evidence that location data was sent off to a remote server. Apple promised to add a new toggle for this feature and in later iOS revisions Apple provided users with the option to tap on the location services indicator in Control Center to see which specific service is using the device's location.
[
233
]
[
234
]
According to published reports by
Bloomberg News
on March 30, 2022, Apple turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and
IP addresses
to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included
forged signatures
of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, an Apple representative referred the reporter to a section of the company policy for law enforcement guidelines, which stated, ""We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.""

Corporate culture
Co-founder
Steve Wozniak
and Macintosh engineer
Andy Hertzfeld
attended the
Apple User Group Connection
club in 1985.
These universities produced the most alumni who became Apple employees.
Apple is one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of
corporate culture
. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a
Fortune 500
company. By the time of the ""
1984
"" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.
[
254
]
According to a 2011 report in
Fortune
, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.
[
255
]
In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching
Star Trek
and attending
Star Trek
conventions
in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.
[
256
]
As the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, some media have suggested that it has lost some of its original character.
[
257
]
[
258
]
[
259
]
[
260
]
Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned.
[
261
]
Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than others.
[
262

Jobs intended that employees were to be specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. For instance,
Ron Johnson
—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores. This was done by Tim Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management.
[
270
]
Apple is known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a ""directly responsible individual"" or ""DRI"" in Apple jargon.
[
255
]
[
271
]
Unlike other major U.S. companies, Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.
[
272
]
In 2015, Apple had 110,000 full-time employees. This increased to 116,000 full-time employees the next year, a notable hiring decrease, largely due to its first revenue decline. Apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail, though its 2014
SEC
filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base.
[
273
]
In September 2017, Apple announced that it had over 123,000 full-time employees.
[
274

Apple has a strong culture of
corporate secrecy
, and has an anti-

Global Security team that recruits from the
National Security Agency
, the

In December 2017,
Glassdoor
said Apple was the 48th best place to work, having originally entered at rank 19 in 2009, peaking at rank 10 in 2012, and falling down the ranks in subsequent years.
[
276
]
In 2023,
Bloomberg
's
Mark Gurman
revealed the existence of Apple's Exploratory Design Group (XDG), which was working to add glucose monitoring to the Apple Watch. Gurman compared XDG to Alphabet's
X ""moonshot factory""

Main articles:
Apple Park
and
Apple Campus
Apple Park is the main headquarters in Cupertino.
Apple Inc.'s world corporate headquarters are located in
Cupertino
, in the middle of California's
Silicon Valley
, at Apple Park, a massive circular
groundscraper
building with a
circumference
of one mile (1.6 km). The building opened in April 2017 and houses more than 12,000 employees. Apple co-founder
Steve Jobs
wanted Apple Park to look less like a
business park
and more like a nature refuge, and personally appeared before the Cupertino City Council in June 2011 to make the proposal, in his final public appearance before his death.
The original Apple Campus has the street address 1 Infinite Loop, Sunnyvale, California.
Apple also operates from the Apple Campus (also known by its address, 1 Infinite Loop), a grouping of six buildings in Cupertino that total 850,000 square feet (79,000 m
2
) located about 1 mile (1.6 km) to the west of Apple Park.
[
278
]
The Apple Campus was the company's headquarters from its opening in 1993, until the opening of Apple Park in 2017. The buildings, located at 1–6
Infinite Loop
, are arranged in a circular pattern around a central
green space
, in a design that has been compared to that of a
university
.
In addition to Apple Park and the Apple Campus, Apple occupies an additional thirty office buildings scattered throughout the city of Cupertino, including three buildings as prior headquarters: Stephens Creek Three from 1977 to 1978, Bandley One from 1978 to 1982, and Mariani One from 1982 to 1993.
[
279
]
In total, Apple occupies almost 40% of the available office space in the city.
[
280
]
Apple's headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are located in
Cork
in the south of
Ireland
, called the Hollyhill campus.
[
281
]
The facility, which opened in 1980, houses 5,500 people and was Apple's first location outside of the United States.
[
282
]
Apple's international sales and distribution arms operate out of the campus in Cork.
[
283
]
Apple has two campuses near Austin, Texas: a 216,000-square-foot (20,100 m
2
) campus opened in 2014 houses 500 engineers who work on
Apple silicon
[
284
]
and a 1.1-million-square-foot (100,000 m
2
) campus opened in 2021 where 6,000 people work in technical support, supply chain management, online store curation, and
Apple Maps
data management. The company also has several other locations in Boulder, Colorado; Culver City, California; Herzliya (Israel), London, New York, Pittsburgh, San Diego, and Seattle that each employ hundreds of people.

Litigation involving Apple Inc.
Apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.

In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include
Apple v. Samsung
,
Apple v. Microsoft
,
Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.
, and
Apple Corps v. Apple Computer
. Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights. Most have been dismissed in the courts as
shell companies
known as
patent trolls
, with no evidence of actual use of
patents
in question.
[

On December 21, 2016, Nokia announced that in the U.S. and Germany, it has filed a suit against Apple, claiming that the latter's products infringe on Nokia's patents.
[

Most recently, in November 2017, the
United States International Trade Commission
announced an investigation into allegations of patent infringement in regards to Apple's remote desktop technology; Aqua Connect, a company that builds remote desktop software, has claimed that Apple infringed on two of its patents.

Apple amassed 65% of all profits made by the eight largest worldwide smartphone manufacturers in quarter one of 2014, according to a report by
Canaccord Genuity
. In the first quarter of 2015, the company garnered 92% of all earnings.
[

On April 30, 2017,
The Wall Street Journal
reported that Apple had
cash reserves
of $250 billion,
[

As of August 3, 2018
[update]
, Apple was the
largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization
. On August 2, 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach a $1 trillion market value,
[

Apple was ranked No. 4 on the 2018
Fortune
500 rankings of the
largest United States corporations by revenue
.
[
306
]
In July 2022, Apple reported an 11% decline in Q3 profits compared to 2021. Its revenue in the same period rose 2% year-on-year to $83 billion, though this figure was also lower than in 2021, where the increase was at 36%. The general downturn is reportedly caused by the slowing global economy and supply chain disruptions in China.
[
307
]
That year, Apple was one of the
largest corporate spenders
on
research and development
worldwide, with R&D expenditure amounting to over $27 billion.
[
308
]
In May 2023, Apple reported a decline in its sales for the first quarter of 2023. Compared to that of 2022, revenue for 2023 fell by 3%. This is Apple's second consecutive quarter of sales decline. This fall is attributed to the slowing economy and consumers putting off purchases of iPads and computers due to increased pricing. However, iPhone sales held up with a year-on-year increase of 1.5%. According to Apple, demands for such devices were strong, particularly in Latin America and South Asia.
[
309
]
Taxes
Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as
Ireland
, the
Netherlands
,
Luxembourg
, and the
British Virgin Islands
to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to
The New York Times
, in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the ""
Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich
"", which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.
[

[

British Conservative Party
Member of Parliament
Charlie Elphicke
published research on October 30, 2012,
[
312
]
which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard
corporate tax
rates. He followed this research by calling on the
Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne
to force these multinationals, which also included
Google
and
The Coca-Cola Company
, to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.
[
313
]
According to a
US Senate
report on the company's offshore tax structure concluded in May 2013, Apple has held billions of dollars in profits in Irish subsidiaries to pay little or no taxes to any government by using an unusual global tax structure.
[
314
]
The main subsidiary, a holding company that includes Apple's retail stores throughout Europe, has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years. ""Apple has exploited a difference between Irish and U.S. tax residency rules"", the report said.
[
315
]
On May 21, 2013, Apple CEO
Tim Cook
defended his company's tax tactics at a Senate hearing.
[

Apple says that it is the single largest taxpayer in the U.S., with an
effective tax rate
of approximately of 26% as of Q2
FY
2016.
[
317
]
In an interview with the German newspaper
FAZ
in October 2017, Tim Cook stated that Apple was the biggest taxpayer worldwide.
[
318
]
In 2016, after
a two-year investigation
, the European Commission claimed that Apple's use of a hybrid
Double Irish tax arrangement
constituted ""illegal state aid"" from Ireland, and ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in unpaid taxes, the largest corporate tax fine in history. This was later annulled, after the
European General Court
ruled that the commission had provided insufficient evidence.

Charity
Apple is a partner of
Product Red
, a fundraising campaign for
AIDS
charity. In November 2014, Apple arranged for all
App Store
revenue in a two-week period to go to the fundraiser,
[
322
]
generating more than US$20 million,
[
323
]
and in March 2017, it released an
iPhone 7
with a red color finish.
[
324
]
Apple contributes financially to fundraisers in times of natural disasters. In November 2012, it donated $2.5 million to the
American Red Cross
to aid relief efforts after
Hurricane Sandy
,
[
325
]
and in 2017 it donated $5 million to relief efforts for both
Hurricane Irma
and
Hurricane Harvey
,
[
326
]
and for the
2017 Central Mexico earthquake
.
[
327
]
The company has used its
iTunes
platform to encourage donations in the wake of environmental disasters and humanitarian crises, such as the
2010 Haiti earthquake
,
[
328
]
the
2011 Japan earthquake
,
[
329
]
Typhoon Haiyan
in the Philippines in November 2013,
[
330
]
and the
2015 European migrant crisis
.
[
331
]
Apple emphasizes that it does not incur any processing or other fees for iTunes donations, sending 100% of the payments directly to relief efforts, though it also acknowledges that the Red Cross does not receive any personal information on the users donating and that the payments may not be tax deductible.

On April 14, 2016, Apple and the
World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF) announced that they have engaged in a partnership to, ""help protect life on our planet"". Apple released a special page in the
iTunes App Store
, Apps for Earth. In the arrangement, Apple has committed that through April 24, WWF will receive 100% of the proceeds from the applications participating in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the In-App Purchases. Apple and WWF's Apps for Earth campaign raised more than $8 million in total proceeds to support WWF's conservation work. WWF announced the results at WWDC 2016 in San Francisco.

During the
COVID-19 pandemic
, Apple's CEO Cook announced that the company will be donating ""millions"" of masks to health workers in the United States and Europe.
[

On January 13, 2021, Apple announced a $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative to help combat
institutional racism
worldwide after the 2020
murder of George Floyd
.
[

Environmental impact of Apple
Apple Energy
Apple Energy, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple Inc. that sells
solar energy
. As of June 6, 2016
[update]
, Apple's solar farms in California and Nevada have been declared to provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity.
[
338
]
Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a
landfill gas energy plant
in
North Carolina
to use the
methane emissions
to generate electricity.
[
339
]
Apple's North Carolina data center is already powered entirely by renewable sources.
[
340
]
Energy and resources
In 2010,
Climate Counts
, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category ""Striding"".
[
341
]
This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a ""stuck icon"", adding that Apple at the time was ""a choice to avoid for the climate-conscious consumer"".
[
342
]
Following a
Greenpeace
protest, Apple released a statement on April 17, 2012, committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100% renewable clean energy.
[
343
]
[
344
]
By 2013, Apple was using
100% renewable energy
to power their data centers. Overall, 75% of the company's power came from clean renewable sources.
[
345
]
In May 2015, Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying, ""Apple's commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry, illustrating in very concrete terms that a 100% renewable Internet is within its reach, and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet.""
[
346
]
As of 2016
[update]
, Apple states that 100% of its U.S. operations run on
renewable energy
, 100% of Apple's
data centers
run on renewable energy and 93% of Apple's global operations run on renewable energy.
[
347
]
However, the facilities are connected to the local
grid
which usually contains a mix of fossil and renewable sources, so Apple
carbon offsets
its electricity use.
[
348
]
The
Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool
(EPEAT) allows consumers to see the effect a product has on the environment. Each product receives a Gold, Silver, or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability. Every Apple
tablet
,
notebook
,
desktop computer
, and
display
that EPEAT ranks achieves a Gold rating, the highest possible. Although Apple's data centers recycle water 35 times,
[
349
]
the increased activity in retail, corporate and data centers also increase the amount of water use to 573 million US gal (2.2 million m
3
) in 2015.
[
350
]
During an event on March 21, 2016, Apple provided a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable in all of its worldwide operations.
Lisa P. Jackson
, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016
[update]
, 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from
post-consumer
recycled
paper or sustainably managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products.
[
351
]
Apple announced on August 16, 2016, that Lens Technology, one of its major suppliers in China, has committed to power all its
glass production
for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by 2018. The commitment is a large step in Apple's efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint in China.
[
352
]
Apple also announced that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with
UL
's Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The standard, which started in January 2015, certifies that all manufacturing waste is
reused
,
recycled
,
composted
, or converted into energy (when necessary). Since the program began, nearly 140,000 metric tons of waste have been diverted from
landfills
.
[
353
]
On July 21, 2020, Apple announced its plan to become
carbon neutral
across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. In the next 10 years, Apple will try to lower emissions with a series of innovative actions, including: low carbon product design, expanding energy efficiency, renewable energy, process and material innovations, and carbon removal.
[
354
]
In June 2024, the
United States Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) published a report about an electronic computer manufacturing facility leased by Apple in 2015 in
Santa Clara, California
, code named Aria.
[
355
]
[
356
]
The EPA report stated that Apple was potentially in violation of federal regulations under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA).
[
355
]
According to a report from
Bloomberg
in 2018, the facility is used to develop
microLED
screens under the code name T159.
[
357
]
[
355
]
[
358
]
The inspection found that Apple was potentially mistreating waste as only subject to
California
regulations and that they had potentially miscalculated the effectiveness of Apple's
activated carbon
filters, which filter
volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) from the air. The EPA inspected the facility in August 2023 due to a tip from a former Apple employee who posted the report on
X
.
[
355
]
Toxins
Following further campaigns by Greenpeace,
[
359
]
in 2008, Apple became the first electronics manufacturer to eliminate all
polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) and
brominated flame retardants
(BFRs) in its complete product line.
[
360
]
In June 2007, Apple began replacing the
cold cathode
fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit
LCD
displays in its computers with
mercury
-free
LED-backlit LCD displays
and
arsenic
-free glass, starting with the upgraded
MacBook Pro
.
[
361
]
[
362
]
[
363
]
[

]
Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the
CO
2
e
,
emissions
, materials, and
electrical usage
concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past (and which they have enough data needed to produce the report), in their portfolio on their homepage. Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale.
[
365
]
In June 2009, Apple's
iPhone 3GS
was free of PVC, arsenic, and BFRs.
[
361
]
[
366
]
Since 2009, all Apple products have mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays, arsenic-free glass, and non-PVC cables.
[
367
]
All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product's respective regulatory category.
[
361
]
[
368
]
In November 2011, Apple was featured in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability,
climate and energy
policy, and how ""green"" their products are. The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10.
[
369
]
Greenpeace praised Apple's
sustainability
, noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. Apple continues to score well on product ratings, with all of their products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticized Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data, and for not setting any targets to reduce emissions.
[
370
]
In January 2012, Apple requested that its cable maker, Volex, begin producing
halogen-free
USB
and power cables.
[
371
]
Green bonds
In February 2016, Apple issued a
US$1.5
billion
green bond
(climate bond), the first ever of its kind by a U.S. tech company. The green bond proceeds are dedicated to the financing of environmental projects.
[

]
Supply chain
Main article:
Apple supply chain
Apple products were made in America in Apple-owned factories until the late 1990s; however, as a result of
outsourcing
initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by
The New York Times
, Apple insiders ""believe the vast scale of overseas factories, as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers, have so outpaced their American counterparts that '
Made in the U.S.A.
' is no longer a viable option for most Apple products"".
[
373
]
The company's manufacturing, procurement, and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: ""Nobody wants to buy sour milk.""
[
374
]
[
375
]
In May 2017, the company announced a $1 billion funding project for ""advanced manufacturing"" in the United States,
[
376
]
and subsequently invested $200 million in
Corning Inc.
, a manufacturer of toughened
Gorilla Glass
technology used in Apple's
iPhones
.
[
377
]
The following December, Apple's chief operating officer,
Jeff Williams
, told
CNBC
that the ""$1 billion"" amount was ""absolutely not"" the final limit on its spending, elaborating that ""We're not thinking in terms of a fund limit... We're thinking about, where are the opportunities across the U.S. to help nurture companies that are making the advanced technology — and the advanced manufacturing that goes with that — that quite frankly is essential to our innovation.""
[
378
]
During the Mac's early history, Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.
[
379
]
This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the
PCI
bus in the
7500
/
8500
/
9500
Power Macs
. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as
USB
,
AGP
,
HyperTransport
,
Wi-Fi
,
NVMe
,
PCIe
and others in its products.
FireWire
is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as
IEEE 1394
and is a legally mandated port in all cable TV boxes in the United States.
[
380
]
Apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market. In July 2012, during a conference call with investors, CEO
Tim Cook
said that he ""[loves] India"", but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region.
[
381
]
India's requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as ""really adds cost to getting product to market"".
[
382
]
In May 2016, Apple opened an iOS app development center in
Bangalore
and a maps development office for 4,000 staff in Hyderabad.
[
383
]
In March,
The Wall Street Journal
reported that Apple would begin manufacturing iPhone models in India ""over the next two months"",
[
384
]
and in May, the
Journal
wrote that an Apple manufacturer had begun production of the
iPhone SE
in the country,
[
385
]
while Apple told
CNBC
that the manufacturing was for a ""small number"" of units.
[
386
]
In April 2019, Apple initiated manufacturing of the iPhone 7 at its
Bengaluru
facility, keeping in mind demand from local customers even as they seek more incentives from the government of India.
[
387
]
At the beginning of 2020, Tim Cook announced that Apple schedules the opening of its first physical outlet in India for 2021, while an online store is to be launched by the end of the year.
[
388
]
The opening of the Apple Store was postponed, and finally took place in April 2023,
[
389
]
while the online store was launched in September 2020.

Worker organizations
Main article:
Apple and unions
Apple directly employs 147,000 workers including 25,000 corporate employees in
Apple Park
and across Silicon Valley.
[
391
]
[
392
]
The vast majority of its employees work at the over 500 retail
Apple Stores
globally.
[
393
]
Apple relies on a larger, outsourced workforce for manufacturing, particularly in China where Apple directly employs 10,000 workers across its retail and corporate divisions. In addition, one further million workers are contracted by Apple's suppliers to assemble Apple products, including
Foxconn
and
Pegatron
.
[
394
]
Zhengzhou Technology Park
alone employs 350,000 Chinese workers in
Zhengzhou
to exclusively work on the
iPhone
.
[
395
]
As of 2021
[update]
, Apple uses hardware components from 43 different countries.
[
396
]
The majority of assembling is done by Taiwanese
original design manufacturer
firms
Foxconn
,
Pegatron
,
Wistron
and
Compal Electronics
in factories primarily located inside
China
,
[
397
]
and, to a lesser extent, Foxconn plants in
Brazil
,
[
398
]
and
India
.
[
399

Apple workers around the globe have been involved in
organizing
since the 1990s.
[

Apple unions are made up of retail, corporate, and outsourced workers. Apple employees have joined
trade unions
or formed
works councils
in
Australia
